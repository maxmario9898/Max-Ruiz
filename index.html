<<h1>How the web shows us emotions by Max Ruiz</h1>

		<<p>It's about time we got stuff on the latest season of castlevania,
		i was afraid it would be cancelled like bojack and MST3K the revival.<br>
		Though to be fair news sometimes slips by us all in any way,
		becoming more outside a persons realm of basic knowledge and outside the
		typical ways we know news by ourselves.</p>

<<p>However this can be attributed a bit,
	towards the ways people share and spread news mostly.
	While also misinterpreting news from other sources,
	as it's spreads on a global scale.<br>
Though this news coverage can still become a bit messy,
since it can make people feel some type of emotion for other people and places.
Due to these kinds of issues, people have felt these certain topics have been
badly explained to us almost from the internet in general.</p>

<p>It leads us into this state of feeling safe, but lets our guard down
in who we may or may not trust.<br>
From this thought process as i said here,
I've made a poem that relates to all these claims in my own writing style.
Showing a bit of caution and scarcity for the internets
descriptions and opinions from the world.</p>

<h2>The web we know</h2>

<p>The web that we know affects us in certain ways,<br>

<br>As it changes how we could feel going on day by day.<br>

<br>We all see the web differently and use it for our own purpose,<br>

<br>it can give us happy emotions but it can also mostly harm us.</p>

<p>It spreads alot of info from all around our world,<br>

<br>while also acting as a way to judge ourselves word by word.<br>

<br>In the end it acts as a price with emotions making you pay,<br>

<br>As the web we know shapes everyone's perceptions within every day.</p>
